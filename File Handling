1.Working of read() mode

# Python code to read() mode 
file = open("file.text", "r") 
print file.read() 

2.print every line one by one in the file

# This will print every line one by one in the file  
file = open('geek.txt', 'r') 
for each in file: 
	print (each)

3. Python code to read() mode character wise 

# Python code to illustrate read() mode character wise 
file = open("file.txt", "r") 
print (file.read(5)) 
 

4. Python code to create a file and write

# Python code to create a file 
file = open('Saleem.txt','w') 
file.write("Welcome all\n") 
file.write("Your limitation—it’s only your imagination") 
file.close() 

5.Python code to for append() mode

# Python code to illustrate append() mode 
file = open('Saleem.txt','a') 
file.write("Good, better, best")
file.close() 

6. Python code to illustrate with() alongwith write() 

# Python code to illustrate with() alongwith write() 
with open("Saleem.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello World!!!") 


7.Python code to split() function 

# Python code to illustrate split() function 
with open("Saleem.txt", "r") as file: 
    data = file.readlines() 
    for line in data:
        word = line.split() 
        print (word) 


8.Python program to reverse the content of a file and store it in another file

f=open("Saleem.txt","w")
with open("geek.txt","r") as myfile:
    data=myfile.read()
data1=data[::-1]
f.write(data1)
f.close()
